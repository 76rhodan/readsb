readsb uses mimalloc as a static override as described here:
- https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/tree/master#single-source
- https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc/overrides.html

Makefile compiles the static override (mimalloc.o)

mimalloc.o: mimalloc/src/static.c
	$(CC) -Imimalloc/include $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

It is linked as a first object

readsb: mimalloc.o readsb.o

why does readsb use mimalloc:
- mulithreading issues with glibc malloc causing crashes
- consistent malloc code across glibc versions
